Clipboard CLI tools so you can send items to and pull items from the clipboard via CLI in both Linux and OSX.
I use this with bidirectional copy paste with a virtual box VM

Install instructions:

copy clipboard.linux to /usr/bin/clipboard on a linux system
copy clipboard.osx to /usr/local/bin/clipboard on a mac

NOTE: this assumes you have functioning pbcopy & pbpaste in mac and xclip in linux
